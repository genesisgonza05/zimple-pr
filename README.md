#### About this:

* Ruby 3.2.1

* PG

* CoffeeScript

* Slim

* Rspec

#### Instructions:

"Create a page with a journalist table with your name and media name.

The page should have a button that allows you to create journalists by displaying a form (eg, within a modal) with a button that sends a POST by Ajax to the Rails application with the parameters to create a journalist.

Refreshing the page again shows you any journalists created and persisted in the database via this path. (You can use Jquery)

Upload the code in github and optionally 'deploya' the resulting application to heroku."
